This is my first webpage built mostly on my own for The Odin Projects Landing Page Project.

The only guidance I received was for the colors being used and the font size, font weight, font style, and font family for a few different items throughout this project.

I learned a lot of important things during this project such as:

1. Inspecting the design and understanding where each section was that needs to be built and how to separate them ahead of time.

2. Building everything out in HTML before even touching CSS to design anything.

3. Working my way through designing the webpage one section at a time from top to bottom.

4. The importance of when to use margins and padding.

Overall this project took me around 5 hours to complete.
